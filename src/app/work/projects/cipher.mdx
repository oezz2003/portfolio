## Overview
**Cipher** is a modern, premium brand that bridges the world of **coding and paper**.  
It reimagines how developers and tech creatives capture ideas by introducing **physical notebooks** designed with the structure and logic of an IDE — but in tangible form.

The goal was to build a **visually stunning digital presence** for Cipher, reflecting its unique philosophy:  
> “Bridging the gap between analog thinking and digital creation.”

## Problem
Most stationery brands focus purely on design, while tech tools ignore the tactile value of writing.  
Cipher’s challenge was to **merge the aesthetics of code editors** with the **warmth of real paper**,  
offering a product that feels both innovative and familiar to developers.

---

## Solution
I designed and developed Cipher’s website using **Next.js 15**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
The result is a **clean, elegant, and immersive experience** that communicates the brand’s hybrid identity —  
where digital precision meets analog creativity.
